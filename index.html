          Since the dawn of recorded history, humankind has wondered, what exactly is in my belly button and how can it make me money? Here at Slin-Tech Industries, 
          we're answering both of those questions. We've taken sample cultures from belly buttons of folks all over the place and partnered with Improbable Beef to 
          test and see which, if any, of those strains of bacteria taste great and can mask the flavor of our other, terrible tasting food products. With our reserach, we hope to usher in
          the next generation of Franken-foods and make oursevles a hefty profit. If our advancements happen to help others, that would also be nice.<br>
          <br>To interact with out dataset, check out the dropdown menu to select a Test Subject ID to see the top 10 bacterial strains from their sample, the size of each 
          culture from their sample, various demographic information about the subject and lastly, how frequently each subject washed their belly<br>
          <br>Slin-Tech Industires is actively looking for investors to create the disgusting hybrid monster food of the future, so if you've got a billion dollars and the appetite, 
          hit me up.<br>
